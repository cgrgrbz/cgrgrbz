<p style='text-align: justify;'>

I am an industrial engineer who is curious about the open-source tools and technologies for productive working environments. I have an interest in optimization solutions, operations research tools, and more. I am currently improving my Java skills with Spring Framework. I am trying to improve my optimization, and simulation skills trough the way of developing the models in Java/Python.
